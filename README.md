# Payroll Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Payroll Management System** is a **menu-driven Java console application** designed to manage employee payroll operations efficiently.
The system demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **interfaces, inheritance, upcasting, loose coupling**, and **collections (ArrayList)**.

It allows users to perform payroll-related tasks through a simple text-based menu.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Interface
  * Inheritance
  * Upcasting
  * Loose Coupling
  * Collections (`ArrayList`)
  * Menu-Driven Programming
  * Encapsulation
  * Polymorphism

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented

### Interface

* Used to define payroll operations
* Ensures abstraction and flexibility

### Inheritance

* Employee classes inherit common properties from a base class

### Upcasting

* Objects are referenced using parent/interface type
* Helps in achieving polymorphism

### Loose Coupling

* Implementation classes are accessed via interfaces
* Improves maintainability and scalability

### Collection Framework

* `ArrayList` is used to store and manage employee objects dynamically
